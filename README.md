# Code Refactoring

## Description

Horiseon is a thriving and innovative social solution service using technology and marketing to jump-start needful companies. However, their website was not up to the standards they praise themselves for. With code refactoring, their website now meets accessibility requirements, is easier for the browser and other developers to understand, and follows HTML semantic structuring. With this new format, their website has remained visually unchanged but allows for easier maintenance and clearly defined importance and context for search engines and user devices. Refactoring code with semantic elements and web accessibility creates a better user experience.
